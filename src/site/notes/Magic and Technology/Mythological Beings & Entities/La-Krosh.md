## La-Krosh

The **La-Krosh** are mysterious, malevolent, ethereal entities, primarily associated with the [[Deepwoods\|Deepwoods]] of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]]. They are known for forming pacts with individuals, granting them power at a significant cost. The term "La-Krosh" functions as a title. Those who possess this power are often known by the name **Darkweaver**, followed by their given name.

### Nature and Characteristics

*   **Ethereal Entity:** The La-Krosh is not a physical being but rather an ethereal entity.  
*   **Malevolent Presence:** They exude an inherently ominous and menacing aura.  
*   **Power Source:** They offer a magic-like power akin to a supernatural force. This power is associated with  **[[Amalon Wiki/Organisations/The Darkweavers\|The Darkweavers]]**.  
*   **Pact and Cost:** Individuals can form pacts with a La-Krosh, gaining power in exchange for a part of their soul. Overuse of this power can lead to the user's demise if they do not take care of themselves.  
*   **Visibility:** A La-Krosh's form is visible to magically attuned individuals, towering over its host like a shadow.  
*   **Awareness:** The La-Krosh is always aware of who can see it.  
*   **Will:** The La-Krosh has its own will and can intimidate those capable of perceiving it, creating an aura of terror.  

### Impact and Perception

*   **Fear and Terror:** The presence of a La-Krosh typically inspires fear in others. Those with magical affinity can sense its presence and are terrified by its overwhelming nature.  
*   **Normalisation:** For individuals who grow up around a La-Krosh, its terrifying appearance may lose its impact over time, becoming normalised.  
*   **Controlled Perception:** Individuals with magical affinity can actively control how they perceive the La-Krosh. They can choose to "wipe" the entity from their immediate perception or view it in a more abstract form.  
*   **Contextual Harm:** While La-Krosh exude a menacing aura, their harm is contextual and may not directly threaten children in the household of someone bound to it.  

### Darkweavers and La-Krosh Weaving

*   **Collaboration:** Organised gangs known as the **Darkweavers** often collaborate with the La-Krosh.  
*   **Power and Secrets:** The Darkweavers seek to harness the powers of the La-Krosh and learn the secrets of **La-Krosh weaving**.  

### Noteworthy Individuals

*   **[[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Zo Rei Wu\|Zo Rei Wu]]:** Wu once made a pact with a La-Krosh, but the entity became stressed due to his excessive use of its powers, nearly resulting in mutual destruction. The pact was broken to prevent their demise.  

### Consequences

*   **Soul Consumption:** Each time a user taps into the La-Krosh's power, it consumes part of their soul.  
*   **Illegality:** Engaging with La-Krosh magic and illegal weaving is a crime, but the power and intimidating nature of the magic often deters witnesses from reporting it.
