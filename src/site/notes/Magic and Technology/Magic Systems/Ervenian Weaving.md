## Ervenian Weaving

**Ervenian Weaving** is a unique and complex art form deeply rooted in the culture and environment of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]]. It is a type of soft magic that relies on a natural connection to the world, lineage, and the power of the soul.

### Core Principles

*   **Soft Magic System:** Unlike more structured magic systems such as [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Astral Magic\|Astral Magic]] or [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Enchanting\|Ervenian Enchanting]], weaving is less about rigid rules and procedures.  
*   **Inheritance:** The ability to weave is often passed down through families, with genetics playing a significant role. There is approximately a 70% chance of an heir inheriting the ability.  
*   **Power Source:** Weaving draws its strength from the natural world and the weaver's own soul. However, some practitioners, known as **Darkweavers**, may tap into demonic energy as an alternative power source.  

### Abilities and Applications

Weaving grants practitioners several unique abilities:  

*   **Short-Distance Teleportation:** Weavers can teleport themselves over short distances, typically just a few meters in any direction.  
*   **Material Shifting:** Weavers can pass through solid objects, such as walls, with ease.  

### Cultural Significance

[[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenians]] hold a deep reverence for nature, viewing it as a source of guidance and wisdom. Weaving is a reflection of this profound connection, with practitioners seeking to harmonise with the world around them.  

### The Deepwoods and Yaebie Trees

The **Deepwoods**, located within [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]], are closely linked to the mysteries of weaving. This unsettling area is home to the unique **Yaebie trees**, which possess unusual characteristics:  

*   They are far more "alive" than ordinary plants, almost resembling alien life.  
*   They undergo a unique process of shedding and regenerating their bark, making them incredibly resilient.  
*   They produce **Yaebie wood**, which burns for extended periods, acting as long-lasting firelogs.  
*   Some claim that the trees whisper at night, reinforcing the mysterious aura of the Deepwoods.  

The Ervenian saying, "Trees recall the forgotten memories," suggests a belief that Yaebie trees may possess sentience or the ability to communicate.  

### Darkweavers and Illegal Activities

**Darkweavers** are individuals who engage in forbidden practices, often collaborating with entities known as the [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]] in the Deepwoods. These groups seek to harness the [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]] 's power and uncover the secrets of **La-Krosh weaving**.  

Those who possess this power are often known by the name **Darkweaver**, followed by their given name.  

Engaging in illegal weaving is a crime, but the power and intimidating nature of the magic often deters witnesses from reporting it.  

### Weavers

Weavers live secluded from the rest of the mainland because they believe that when isolated, the mind works best.
