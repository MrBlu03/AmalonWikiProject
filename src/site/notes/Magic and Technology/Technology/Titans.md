**Titans** are colossal, humanoid constructs primarily associated with **[[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'oth Vilgmeri]]**. Initially designed to aid in manual labour, they have since been adapted for military purposes.

### Origins and Development

*   **Discovery in Jakje’Vok:** The prototype Titan was discovered in the woods near the city of **Jakje’Vok**. It was a half-completed contraption, resembling a gigantic human, approximately one hundred meters tall.  
*   **Initial Purpose:** Architects created blueprints to construct the first Titan, intending it to assist with manual labour and simplify tasks. They were used in the construction of buildings and general institutions.  

### Design and Operation

*   **Cockpit:** The main pilot maneuvers the Titan from the cockpit, determining the mech's mode (utility or offense).  
*   **Arm Control:** The left and right arms are controlled by two separate pilots, each with specific tasks assigned by the main pilot.  
*   **Power Source:** Titans are powered by energised cells contained within, further reinforced by enchantments.  

### Applications

*   **Construction:** Originally designed to aid in the construction of buildings and other infrastructure.  
*   **Farming:** Also used for farming purposes, assisting with manual labour in agriculture.  
*   **Military:** Armed with weaponry, Titans are used to defend against threats.  
    *   During a **[[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|Valomorian]]** invasion, Titans helped demolish students storming from the shore.  

### Theories of Origin

*   **Grotls:** There is a theory that the original construct was created by the **grotls**. Evidence suggests that grotls may have inhabited the continent ages ago before moving to another dimension.  
*   **Complexity:** The machination is considered too complex to have been constructed with the simple tools available to humans at the time. The construct patterns also differ, with scaffolding requiring more material due to the grotls' smaller size (about a third of human size).
