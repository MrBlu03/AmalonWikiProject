Ancient scholars chosen by [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/The Thymr\|Tyria]] to serve as the guardians and students of [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Libraries of Tyria\|The Libraries of Tyria]]. Originally consisting of six primary keepers, the [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|Yuthims]] established a tradition of passing their knowledge through carefully selected apprentices over many generations.

## Origins

The original six [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|Yuthims]] were personally selected by [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/The Thymr\|Tyria]], goddess of knowledge, to catalog and study the contents of her libraries. Each was chosen for their exceptional intellectual capabilities and unwavering dedication to the pursuit of knowledge.

## Responsibilities

The [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|Yuthims]] were tasked with:
- Reading and memorizing the contents of [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Libraries of Tyria\|The Libraries of Tyria]]
- Teaching chosen apprentices
- Preserving the knowledge contained within the libraries
- Protecting dangerous knowledge from misuse
- Maintaining the physical collections

## The Apprentice System

Each [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|Yuthim]] would select and train apprentices to carry on their work. This system continued for over a hundred generations, creating an unbroken chain of knowledge preservation. The selection process was rigorous, with potential apprentices being tested for both intellectual capacity and moral character.

## Persecution

Fear of the knowledge they possessed eventually led to widespread persecution. The [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|Yuthims]] and their apprentices were captured and subjected to brutal punishment:
- Their mouths were sewn shut to prevent them from sharing knowledge
- Their hands were bound to stop them from writing
- Many were imprisoned in isolated locations
- Communication between [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|Yuthims]] was forbidden

## Powers and Abilities

Before their imprisonment, [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|Yuthims]] were said to possess remarkable abilities:
- Perfect recall of any text they had read
- Understanding of multiple ancient languages
- Knowledge of [[Magic and Technology/Key Concepts/Realm Shifts\|Realm Shifts]] and dimensional travel
- Mastery of various forms of magic, including [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Enchanting\|Ervenian Enchanting]] and [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Weaving\|Ervenian Weaving]]
- The ability to perceive [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]] and other supernatural entities

## Legacy

The fate of [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|The Yuthims]] serves as a stark reminder of the price of knowledge in Amalon. Their story is particularly significant in:
- [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|High Valomor]], where scholars study their methods of knowledge preservation
- [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]], where their understanding of magic is still researched
- Academic circles throughout Amalon, where they represent both the heights of scholarship and its potential dangers

## Modern Day

While no confirmed [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|Yuthims]] exist in the present day, some scholars believe their descendants still preserve ancient knowledge in secret. Various groups throughout Amalon claim to possess fragments of [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|Yuthimic]] knowledge, though none have been verified.
