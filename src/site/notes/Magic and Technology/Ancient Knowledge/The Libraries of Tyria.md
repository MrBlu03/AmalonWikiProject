Three legendary repositories of knowledge created by [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/The Thymr\|Tyria]], the goddess of knowledge. These libraries are said to contain the collected wisdom and secrets of existence, guarded by [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|The Yuthims]] who were tasked with studying and preserving their contents.

## History

According to ancient texts, Tyria constructed these libraries in her quest to gather all knowledge in existence. She appointed six [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|yuthims]] as the original custodians, tasked with reading and studying every book within the libraries' walls. This tradition of knowledge-keeping would be passed down through generations of apprentices.

## The Fall

The libraries' downfall came when fear spread among the population regarding the power of their collected knowledge. The [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|yuthims]] and their apprentices were eventually imprisoned, their mouths sewn shut and hands bound to prevent them from sharing or recording the dangerous knowledge they possessed.

## Layout and Contents

Each of the three libraries is said to have contained different spheres of knowledge:

1. The Library of Life - Housing texts on natural philosophy, medicine, and the nature of existence
2. The Library of Death - Containing forbidden knowledge, dark arts, and mysteries of mortality
3. The Library of Balance - Preserving historical records, mathematical principles, and cosmic laws

## Legacy

The imprisonment of [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|The Yuthims]] and subsequent abandonment of the libraries has left their true location unknown. Many [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Weaving\|magical practitioners]] and scholars have sought them throughout history, believing the libraries contain powerful secrets about [[Magic and Technology/Key Concepts/Realm Shifts\|Realm Shifts]], [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]], and other mystical phenomena.

## Modern Significance

While most consider [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Libraries of Tyria\|The Libraries of Tyria]] to be mythological, some scholars, particularly those studying [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Enchanting\|enchanting]] and [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Weaving\|weaving]], believe the libraries still exist in some form. The tale serves as a warning about the dangers of pursuing forbidden knowledge, while also representing the eternal human desire to understand the mysteries of existence.

## Cultural Impact

The story of [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Libraries of Tyria\|The Libraries of Tyria]] and [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|The Yuthims]] has become a cautionary tale throughout Amalon about the price of knowledge. The image of the sewn-mouthed [[Magic and Technology/Ancient Knowledge/The Yuthims\|yuthims]] remains a powerful symbol in art and literature, particularly in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] and [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|High Valomor]], where scholarly pursuit is highly valued.
