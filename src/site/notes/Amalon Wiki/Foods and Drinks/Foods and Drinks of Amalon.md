# Foods and Drinks of Amalon

## Regional Cuisines

### Ervenian Cuisine
The cuisine of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] is perhaps best exemplified in [[Fiarma Zan\|Fiarma Zan]], known throughout Amalon for its distinctive cooking traditions. One of their most celebrated dishes is roasted [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Rima\|Rima]], prepared from a unique green bird native to their inner cities. 

Fishing plays a central role in Ervenian food culture, serving both as sustenance and recreation. The people of [[Fiarma Zan\|Fiarma Zan]] regularly hold fishing competitions, challenging participants to catch a specific amount of fish in the fastest time or land the largest specimen possible within a given timeframe. These competitions are not just about sustenance but form a core part of their recreational activities.

The most culturally significant beverage in Ervenian culture is [[Yala\|Yala]], a sweet drink crafted from tree resin and special leaves. This drink is deeply woven into Ervenian social fabric through the Mimito tradition, where every twentieth sunrise, all Ervenians, regardless of their location, share a glass of Yala to celebrate life. This tradition demonstrates the unifying power of food and drink in Ervenian culture. The significance of Yala extends beyond [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] 's borders, with [[Cusomi\|Cusomi]] becoming known as the "Coast of happiness" partially due to their tradition of greeting arriving sailors with this ceremonial beverage.

## Common Dishes

### Seafood
The waters of [[Var Ispar\|Var Ispar]] are home to the [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Twintail\|Twintail]] fish, which despite being the dominant species in these waters, is ironically known as the least intelligent. This fish features prominently in cuisine across Amalon, prepared in several traditional ways:
- Dried [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Twintail\|Twintail]] snacks (a popular tavern fare)
- [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Twintail\|Twintail]] filet with parsley and melted butter (considered a refined preparation)
- Grilled [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Twintail\|Twintail]] pluthr with white aiya sauce and greenery (favored by the wealthy class)

### Meat Dishes
- Chopped hirmet served with onions and burbari bacon represents hearty traditional fare
- Pjirkari steak complemented by jurh sauce and fresh salad stands as a premium dish
- Fried syada, traditionally served with soup, offers a lighter option
- Traditional breakfast plates featuring freshly baked eggs and various meats provide sustenance for the working class

## Beverages

### Ales and Spirits
**[[Visther Ale\|Visther Ale]]** holds particular historical significance. Originally created in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]], it became the center of a major trade dispute when [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'oth Vilgmeri]] adapted the recipe by using syrup instead of the raw plant. This modification proved advantageous as the leftover bark found use in medicine, but the ensuing legal battle over its origin nearly bankrupted [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'oth Vilgmeri]] through debts to Juvali.

**[[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Rambish\|Rambish]] Ale**, named after the wild [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Rambish\|Rambish]] found in the northern wilds of the White Forest, offers a unique drinking experience. The initial bitter taste gives way to a spicy sensation that creates what's described as "a strangely pleasurable feeling" in the throat.

**Kjoithita** stands as one of Amalon's most potent beverages. Two drinks typically result in complete memory loss of the evening. However, it's particularly famous for its unique after-effect - those who drink it report extraordinary mental clarity the following morning, with focus described as sharp as an iskrath on the hunt.

Additional notable spirits include:
- **Teethkicker**
- **Jorjathvar**
- **Uruja Ghun**

All these require special licenses and patents to sell legally.

### Non-Alcoholic Beverages
- **Boldflower lemonade** serves as a refreshing option, sold by merchants like Ymyla for three Wisps per cup
- **Kiiri tea** distinguishes itself through its pitch-black color, offering drinkers a sweet taste followed by a bitter finish

### Industrial Liquids
While not for consumption, rasha plays a fascinating role in Amalon's commercial history. This golden-colored liquid originated in [[Golden Ramsen\|Golden Ramsen]] as a defensive measure against pirates. When raiders would strike the shores of Juval to steal possessions, inhabitants began coating their valuables in rasha. The original formula contained emilium, which caused permanent lung damage when inhaled, serving as a deterrent to thieves. Modern versions use a safer compound called lynate, though the liquid remains popular in gold forgery and is frequently misused for smuggling goods across seas.

## [[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/The Drunken Sails Tavern\|The Drunken Sails Tavern]]

Under the proprietorship of [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Jo'Ori Amyja\|Jo'Ori Amyja]], this establishment stands as a testament to Amalon's rich culinary traditions. Maintaining an impressive 97% satisfaction rate, the tavern owes much of its success to the combined talents of weekend chef [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Minor Characters/Vithuros Alid\|Vithuros Alid]] and weekday chef [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Minor Characters/Daqtar Hefr\|Daqtar Hefr]].

[[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Jo'Ori Amyja\|Jo'Ori Amyja]] himself contributes significantly to the tavern's reputation through his mastery of beverages, capable of preparing over thirty different drinks blindfolded. This expertise particularly shines during busy hours when the tavern floods with customers.

A special mug remains perpetually at the bar, reserved for Mildegrad Stout in memory of [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Pumer Pfy Joka\|Pumer Pfy Joka]]. This simple gesture speaks to how food and drink interweave with memory and relationship throughout Amalon's culture.

Materials and pricing for the tavern's offerings come primarily from the market square or local butchers. The competition between establishments remains notably high, affecting pricing structures and encouraging innovation in both food and drink offerings.
