In the depths of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] 's [[Deepwoods\|Deepwoods]], the Darkweavers practice their forbidden arts through pacts with the [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]], representing one of [[Amalon\|Amalon]] 's most secretive and feared magical traditions.  

## Nature and Origins

The Darkweavers exist not as an organization but as scattered practitioners bound by their use of forbidden magic. Each Darkweaver has forged a personal pact with a [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]], mysterious entities that dwell within the [[Deepwoods\|Deepwoods]] 's darkest reaches. The title "Darkweaver" specifically denotes one who has made such a pact, marking them as a wielder of corrupt soul magic.

Unlike traditional [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Weaving\|Ervenian Weaving]], which draws power from nature and the weaver's own soul, Darkweavers substitute this natural connection with demonic energy gained through their supernatural patrons. This perversion of traditional weaving practices has earned them the fear and disgust of most [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenians]].

## Powers and Abilities

A Darkweaver's power manifests through their corruption of traditional [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Weaving\|Ervenian Weaving]], granting them abilities including:

- Short-range teleportation 
- Phasing through solid objects
- Manipulation of soul energies
- Drawing power directly from their [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]] patron

However, these abilities exact a terrible price. Each use of their power consumes a portion of the practitioner's soul. Many Darkweavers meet their end through overuse of these abilities, their essence completely devoured by the [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]] they sought to harness.

Most notably, their magic remains invisible to all except the caster, making their activities nearly impossible to track or counter. This aspect of their power has made them particularly dangerous and difficult to apprehend.

## The La-Krosh Pact

The [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]] themselves remain enigmatic beings, their true nature known only to those who have forged pacts with them. They manifest as towering shadows, visible only to those with magical attunement. Their presence creates an aura of terror, though curiously, those who grow up around bound [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]] may become desensitized to their horrifying nature.

The exact process of binding oneself to a [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]] remains poorly understood, though the results are well documented - supernatural power granted in exchange for pieces of the practitioner's soul. What the [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]] gain from these bargains remains unknown.

## Activities 

Darkweavers operate primarily through loose criminal gangs, using their abilities for various illicit activities. Their power to phase through solid objects makes them particularly effective thieves, while their invisible magic allows them to operate without leaving evidence.

Their activities have made the [[Deepwoods\|Deepwoods]] increasingly dangerous, with hunters and travelers frequently disappearing without trace. While many dismiss tales of shadows that devour souls as mere superstition, those who have encountered Darkweavers know the terrible truth behind these stories.

## Cultural Impact

The existence of Darkweavers has significantly impacted [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenian]] society. Traditional [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Weaving\|weavers]], who already lived in seclusion due to the nature of their soul magic, have become even more isolated to avoid association with their darker counterparts.

The fear of Darkweavers has led to increased suspicion of any magical practice, particularly in regions near the [[Deepwoods\|Deepwoods]]. Many witnesses to their activities remain silent, either through fear of reprisal or simple disbelief in what they've seen.

## Modern Day

Today, Darkweavers continue their shadowy practices in the depths of the [[Deepwoods\|Deepwoods]], their numbers neither growing nor diminishing significantly. Their continued existence serves as a reminder of the darker aspects of [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Weaving\|Ervenian Weaving]] and the terrible price some are willing to pay for power.

## Trivia
- While extremely rare, [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]] pacts can be broken - [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Zo Rei Wu\|Zo Rei Wu]] famously broke his pact when excessive use nearly killed both him and the entity
- Some regions near the [[Deepwoods\|Deepwoods]] maintain specific laws and punishments for Darkweaver activities, though enforcement proves nearly impossible due to the invisible nature of their magic
