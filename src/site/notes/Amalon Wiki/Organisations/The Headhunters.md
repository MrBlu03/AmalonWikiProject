The Headhunters represent Arimant's primary governmental force tasked with the pursuit and apprehension of magic practitioners. Their existence reflects the region's strict policies against magical practices and its systematic approach to maintaining control over supernatural forces.

## Organization

As an official governmental body, the Headhunters operate with full state authority to investigate, pursue, and capture anyone suspected of practicing magic within Arimant's borders. Their reach extends from the highest levels of society to the most remote regions under Arimant control.

## Methods and Operations

The Headhunters employ sophisticated tracking and investigation techniques to root out magic users. Their primary focus lies in discovering hidden magical operations, particularly those involving the trade of magical items or substances. They are known for:

- Conducting thorough investigations of suspected magical activities
- Maintaining surveillance networks
- Organizing raids on discovered hideouts
- Forcing magic users to flee across borders

## Notable Cases

### The Amyja Family Pursuit

One of the most documented cases involves the pursuit of the Amyja family, a group of skilled sorcerers who operated a covert trading network for magical potions and elixirs. The family consisted of:

- Esolde Amyja: A powerful healer
- Wethfey Amyja: An accomplished weather manipulator and skilled drink maker
- Their young son Jonemi (later known as [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Jo'Ori Amyja\|Jo'Ori Amyja]])

The Headhunters' investigation led to the discovery of the family's hideout, forcing them to flee to [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'oth Vilgmeri]]. This case particularly demonstrates the Headhunters' efficiency in uncovering even well-hidden magical operations.

## Impact on Society

The Headhunters' activities have significantly shaped Arimant's relationship with magic, leading to:

- A culture of secrecy among magic users
- The establishment of underground networks for magical trade
- Regular migration of magic practitioners to more tolerant regions
- Strained relationships with regions that accept magical practices
