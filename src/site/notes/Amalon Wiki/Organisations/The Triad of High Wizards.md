# The Triad of High Wizards

Far from the bustling kingdoms of [[Amalon\|Amalon]] dwell three of the realm's most powerful magical practitioners - the Triad of High Wizards. These mysterious figures are said to maintain the world's harmony through their considerable magical might, though their methods and true nature remain shrouded in mystery.

## Nature and Power

The Triad's reputation for immortality has persisted through generations, though whether this represents literal deathlessness or simply exceptional longevity remains a matter of debate. Their magical abilities are said to far exceed those of even accomplished practitioners of [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Astral Magic\|Astral Magic]] or [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Ervenian Weaving\|Ervenian Weaving]], though the exact nature of their powers remains unknown.

## Location and Isolation

The Triad maintains their residence in a remote location far removed from the influence of [[Amalon\|Amalon]] 's major kingdoms. This self-imposed isolation appears deliberate, allowing them to maintain their role as neutral arbiters of harmony while remaining detached from the day-to-day politics of the realm.

Their remote location has contributed to their mystique, with few individuals ever gaining an audience with the three wizards. Those who have made the journey report that the Triad requires substantial evidence before they will consider involving themselves in any matter brought before them.

## Role in Amalon

As maintainers of harmony across [[Amalon\|Amalon]], the Triad theoretically wields considerable influence over the realm's affairs. However, they appear to exercise this power sparingly and according to their own inscrutable criteria. Their exact methods for maintaining this balance remain unknown, as does the full extent of their authority.

## Personality and Approach

The Triad is widely known for their arrogance and unwavering belief in their own methods. This rigidity in their approach has earned them a reputation for being difficult to work with, even in matters of great importance. Their demand for concrete proof before taking action suggests a methodical, if inflexible, approach to their duties.

## Influence and Limitations

Despite their considerable power, the Triad's influence appears to be self-limiting. Their insistence on solid proof before acting and their general aloofness means they rarely intervene directly in [[Amalon\|Amalon]] 's affairs. This hands-off approach has led some to question the true extent of their role in maintaining harmony across the realm.

## Legacy

The Triad's continued existence serves as a reminder of [[Amalon\|Amalon]] 's deep connection to magic and the importance of maintaining balance between its various powers. Whether viewed as guardians or as remote observers, their presence remains a significant factor in the realm's magical and political landscape.

## Trivia

- The Triad's true ages remain unknown, though their reputation for immortality has persisted for generations
- No recorded instance exists of the Triad acting without first requiring substantial proof
- Their remote location is said to be unreachable by normal means
- Despite their role in maintaining harmony, they rarely intervene directly in conflicts between kingdoms
