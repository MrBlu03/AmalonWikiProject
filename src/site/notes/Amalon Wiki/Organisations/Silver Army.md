# The Silver Army

The [[Amalon Wiki/Organisations/Silver Army\|Silver Army]] stands as [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's premier military force, renowned across [[Amalon\|Amalon]] for their distinctive silver armor and exceptional combat prowess. From their humble beginnings as city guards to their current status as an elite fighting force, the Silver Army has shaped the military landscape of the region.

## Origins

The Silver Army traces its roots to the guards who once protected the old capital, now known as the Unwelcomed City. During the height of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's trading era, these predecessors - known as the Silver Knights - served as gatekeepers, ensuring the authenticity of goods entering the city and maintaining security. Their signature silver armor, resistant to both common magic and conventional weapons, became a symbol of their authority and effectiveness.

When the capital relocated, these guards evolved into [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's official military force, eventually becoming the Silver Army we know today. This transformation marked a significant shift from mere city protection to a full-fledged military organization capable of defending the nation's interests both at home and abroad.

## Structure and Organization

The Silver Army operates through a complex hierarchy of divisions, with the legendary Juyva One representing their elite forces. Under the command of General [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Supporting Characters/Armid'Ro Podati\|Armid'Ro Podati]], the army maintained strict command structures while fostering a sense of brotherhood among its ranks.

Notable commanders and soldiers have included:

- [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Mar'Keth Vithyaini\|Mar'Keth Vithyaini]], leader of Juyva One division and renowned for his combat prowess
- Captain [[Lam Ter\|Lam Ter]], a respected trainer and officer
- [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Minor Characters/Jandi\|Jandi]], a soldier who joined seeking financial stability for his family

Each division operates with significant autonomy while maintaining coordination through a sophisticated chain of command. The army divides its training grounds between officer and soldier sections, ensuring specialized instruction for each role.

## Training and Combat

The Silver Army's training regime stands among the most rigorous in [[Amalon\|Amalon]]. New recruits undergo intensive three-year programs covering:

- Weapons mastery, including traditional arms and specialized equipment
- Shield combat and defensive techniques
- Strategic deployment and battlefield tactics
- Unit coordination and command structure
- Specialized combat stances and forms

The army's signature silver armor, while exceptionally heavy, provides unparalleled protection against magical attacks. This unique advantage comes at the cost of reduced mobility and vulnerability to certain specialized weapons designed to pierce their defenses.

## Military Life and Benefits

Service in the Silver Army offers significant rewards, including:

- Substantial pay during active duty
- Housing provisions after three years of service
- Comprehensive combat training
- Brotherhood and camaraderie
- Respected position in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] society

However, these benefits come with perpetual obligations - the army reserves the right to recall any former soldier to active duty when needed.

## Notable Campaigns and Conflicts

The Silver Army has participated in numerous significant conflicts, most notably:

- The war against [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|High Valomor]], precipitated by complex political machinations
- Defense of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'oth Vilgmeri]] against Valomorian aggression
- Multiple engagements protecting [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's trading interests
- Internal conflicts resulting from [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Supporting Characters/Armid'Ro Podati\|Armid'Ro Podati]] 's conspiracy

One particularly devastating incident involved the ambush of Juyva One division during a diplomatic mission, revealing vulnerabilities in their traditional tactics against [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Astral Magic\|Astral Magic]] wielders.

## Equipment and Arsenal

The Silver Army's equipment represents some of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's finest military technology:

### Armor
- Enchanted silver plate armor resistant to magical attacks
- Specialized helmets designed for maximum visibility
- Reinforced joints allowing for combat mobility despite weight

### Weapons
- Traditional swords and shields
- Crossbows for ranged engagement
- Specialized weapons like flails and wrist-mounted devices
- Various close-combat implements

## Culture and Values

Despite [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's general aversion to violence, the Silver Army maintains a complex relationship with martial prowess. They embrace combat excellence while adhering to strict codes of conduct. Their motto "Good soldiers follow orders" reflects their emphasis on discipline and hierarchy.

The organization fosters deep bonds between its members, creating lifelong connections that persist beyond active service. This brotherhood mentality strengthens unit cohesion while sometimes leading to conflicts of loyalty during political upheavals.

## Legacy and Modern Day

Today's Silver Army continues to evolve, adapting to new threats while maintaining their traditional strengths. The betrayal by [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Supporting Characters/Armid'Ro Podati\|Armid'Ro Podati]] and subsequent reforms have led to increased scrutiny of high-level commands while reinforcing the importance of individual soldier integrity.

The sacrifice of soldiers like [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Mar'Keth Vithyaini\|Mar'Keth Vithyaini]], who died protecting [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Raim Aer\|Raim Aer]] from [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Aradoth\|Aradoth]], exemplifies the Army's dedication to their duties and each other. Their continued service ensures [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's position as a major military power in [[Amalon\|Amalon]], despite the challenges posed by magical adversaries and political intrigue.
