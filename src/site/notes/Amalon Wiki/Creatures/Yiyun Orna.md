## Description
A specialized arctic variant of the [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Orna\|Orna]] species, Yiyun [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Orna\|Orna]] are notable for their unique adaptations to extreme cold environments. They are mostly blind, relying on their highly developed sense of smell for navigation, and are distinguished by their inability to breathe through their noses despite using them for sensory input.

## Habitat
- Natural environment: Permanent snow regions, particularly in far southern [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|High Valomor]]
- Geographic location: Snow-covered territories where temperatures reach -29 degrees
- Territory size: Varies based on available resources and pack size

## Biology
- Size: Similar to standard [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Orna\|Orna]] but with thicker build
- Lifespan: 10-15 years in wild conditions
- Diet: Carnivorous, adapted to arctic prey
- Reproduction: Smaller litters than standard [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Orna\|Orna]] due to harsh environment
- Special abilities: 
  - Advanced olfactory navigation
  - Mouth-only breathing system
  - Extreme cold resistance

## Behavior
- Social structure: Pack-based, highly cooperative
- Activity patterns: Active in both day and night, adapted to arctic conditions
- Hunting/Feeding habits: Must hold breath while using nose for tracking
- Defensive mechanisms: Pack coordination, cold resistance

## Interaction with Civilizations
- Domestication status: Semi-domesticated in arctic regions
- Cultural significance: Valued by arctic communities for their tracking abilities
- Economic value: Prized as guides and companions in extreme environments
- Threats to humans: Generally non-aggressive unless threatened

## Conservation
- Population status: Stable but limited to specific habitats
- Threats: Climate changes affecting arctic environments
- Protection measures: Protected within [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|High Valomor]] territories

## Additional Information
- Common names: Snow [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Orna\|Orna]], Blind Hunter
- Related species: Standard [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Orna\|Orna]]
- Historical significance: Important role in arctic exploration and survival
- Notable incidents: Known to coexist with [[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Ashkari\|Ashkari]] in their harsh habitat
