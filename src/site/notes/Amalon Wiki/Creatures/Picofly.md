## Description
[[Amalon Wiki/Creatures/Picofly\|Picoflies]] are parasitic insects known for their unique reproductive cycle and dangerous nature. They are characterized by their ability to paralyze larger animals and their bioluminescent glow.

## Habitat
- Natural environment: Dense forests and wooded areas
- Geographic location: Primarily found in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]], particularly common in dense forested regions
- Territory size: Highly mobile, no fixed territory

## Biology
- Size: Small insect, approximately thumb-sized
- Lifespan: 2-3 months in adult form
- Diet: Parasitic, requires host animals for reproduction
- Reproduction: Parasitic reproduction cycle where offspring develop inside paralyzed hosts
- Special abilities: Can paralyze prey many times their size, bioluminescent capabilities

## Behavior
- Social structure: Solitary hunters
- Activity patterns: Most active during dawn and dusk
- Hunting/Feeding habits: Paralyzes prey animals to inject eggs into their digestive system
- Defensive mechanisms: Fast flight, ability to paralyze threats

## Interaction with Civilizations
- Domestication status: Cannot be domesticated
- Cultural significance: Feared by travelers and locals alike
- Economic value: Some alchemists harvest their paralytic compounds
- Threats to humans: Significant threat, known to attack humans if desperate for hosts

## Biology Detail
*Reproduction Cycle:*
1. Adult picofly paralyzes prey animal
2. Injects eggs deep into the host's digestive system
3. Larvae feed within the host
4. Fully grown picoflies emerge from the host

## Additional Information
- Common names: Death fly, paralyze bug
- Related species: Various non-parasitic flying insects

- Notable incidents: Known to cause particular fear in [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Pumer Pfy Joka\|Pumer]], who has an intense aversion to large insects

## Conservation
- Population status: Abundant in native regions
- Threats: None significant
