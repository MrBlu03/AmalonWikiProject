### Overview

[[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'Oth Vilgmeri]] is a kingdom in the world of [[Amalon\|Amalon]] known for its **strong nationalistic sentiment**, a **general distrust of outsiders**, and a history marked by conflict and internal turmoil. The kingdom's inhabitants, the Vilgmeri, are often described as rough, insular, and fiercely loyal to their homeland.

### Culture

The culture of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'Oth Vilgmeri]] is steeped in tradition, with a strong emphasis on self-reliance and a deep-rooted suspicion of foreign influence. The Vilgmeri value strength, resilience, and a willingness to defend their kingdom against any perceived threat. They have a unique language, distinct from other kingdoms, and they use the term "**zuthr**" as a derogatory slur for outsiders. Their cultural practices include:

- Public displays of fighting are commonplace.
- They have a vibrant musical tradition, with instruments such as the multi-stringed wood instrument that produces high-pitched sounds.

### Economy

The sources provide limited information on [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'Oth Vilgmeri]]'s economy. However, it can be inferred that:

- **Trade** plays a role, but the kingdom is not as open to trade as other kingdoms like [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]]. Historically, an influx of immigrants nearly caused an economic collapse, leading to increased isolationism.
- The kingdom's economy has been negatively impacted by the **strained relationship with [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|High Valomor]]**, as trade with [[Cusomi\|Cusomi]] and [[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/Hidden Lowval\|Hidden Lowval]] has ceased. This suggests that some level of inter-kingdom commerce existed previously.
