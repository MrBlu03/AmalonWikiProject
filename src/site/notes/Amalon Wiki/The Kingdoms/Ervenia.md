## Overview

[[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] is a kingdom in Amalon known for its peace, magic, and harmonious relationship with nature. Ervenians are renowned for their kindness, unique architectural designs, and the intriguing, sometimes intimidating, insects that inhabit their lands.

### Culture

**Ervenians have a deep reverence for nature and view it as a guiding force in their lives**. They do not believe in gods or deities but see natural events like rain, drought, and even joy as expressions of nature itself. They believe that the sun and moon are nature's "eyes", watching over the world day and night.

- Every twentieth sunrise, Ervenians participate in a tradition called **Mimito**, where they drink a glass of [[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/Jua La Va\|Jua La Va]], a sweet drink made from tree resin and special leaves, to celebrate life. This custom is observed by all Ervenians, regardless of where they live.

- Ervenians do not require beds to sleep. Their bodies are flexible, allowing them to sleep in various positions without experiencing back pain.

- Fishing is a significant part of Ervenian culture, serving both as a source of food and a recreational activity. They hold fishing competitions to test speed and skill.

- Ervenians believe that digging deep holes could unearth dangerous monsters lurking below the surface. This belief stems from their comfort with deep waters but a fear of the unknown beneath the ground.

- **Weaving is considered a form of soul magic in Ervenian culture**. It is associated with threading a needle through the fabric of life and creating something new. Weavers often live in seclusion, believing that isolation enhances their creative process.

### Economy

**[[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/Cusomi\|Cusomi]] serves as the central hub of trade and income for [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]]**, facilitating the movement of goods throughout Amalon. They exclusively use gold as currency. The city is known for its bustling trade activities, both day and night.

- The **Trident Act** integrates Ertho Kal, [[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/Cusomi\|Cusomi]], and Fiarma Zan into a shared trade segment. Goods imported to one city can be freely redistributed among the others without further inspection.

- Food is a tightly controlled commodity in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]], with regular inspections by food officials.

- Despite strict regulations, organised crime exists, with incidents of food poisoning and ransom demands. However, increased security measures have effectively reduced such occurrences.

- [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] has a long history of maritime trade and was once a major trading partner with [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'oth Vilgmeri]] through the Forgotten Haven. However, trade has ceased since the haven's closure 23 years ago.

### Geography

[[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] is characterised by diverse landscapes, including:

- **Deepwoods:** Known for their unsettling nature and the mysterious disappearances of hunters. The Deepwoods are home to Yaebie trees, which are exceptionally durable and regenerate through a unique shedding process. Some believe these trees may be sentient.

- **Coastlines:** With bustling harbours like [[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/Cusomi\|Cusomi]] and Ertho Kal, the coastlines are crucial for trade and transportation.

- **Forests:** [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] possesses lush forests teeming with various plant and animal life. The Ervenies, the earliest inhabitants of Amalon, developed a strong connection with nature in these forests.

- **Mountains:** The Mountains of R'Oth border [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] and are known for their diverse goat species.

### History

- **Dawn of Origin (0/1'O):** Ervenies, the first bipedal animals on Amalon, emerged in forests and mountains, evolving over millions of years to adapt to the harsh environment. They developed communication, societal structures, and a deep respect for nature.

- **Expansion and Migration:** A portion of the Ervenies migrated across the sea, eventually leading to the formation of the Vjoondr and Umrags groups. They established [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]], relying on hunting to fend off hostiles.

- **Trade with Humans:** The Dalnari, who later evolved into humans, encountered the Ervenies and established trade relations. Over time, their languages intertwined, creating a hybrid understood by both parties.

- **Present Day:** [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] continues to thrive as a peaceful kingdom with a strong connection to nature. They have maintained their cultural traditions and unique approach to magic and governance.

### Politics

[[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] is governed by a hierarchical system:

- **Chief (President):** Elected every 75 years from a pool of Divitis. They make decisions that are implemented in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] and adopted by coordinated states.

- **Diviti (Vice-president):** Elected officials responsible for the political, economic, and social aspects of governance in their respective cities (Ertho Kal, [[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/Cusomi\|Cusomi]], and Fiarma Zan).

- **Councilors:** Advise the Divitis but do not have decision-making power.

- **Senators:** Apply rules made by the Divitis to their appointed city.

- **Local Government:** Apply local rules and enforce those from higher authorities.

- **Zoradi:** A special election day held every ten years where Diviti candidates present their proposed changes to the existing system.

### Cities

- **Ertho Kal:** A major port city known for its numerous harbours and bustling trade activities. The **Initho Eza**, a large tower in the city centre, serves as a lighthouse at night, guiding sailors through the misty seas.

- **[[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/Cusomi\|Cusomi]]:** The "**Coast of Happiness**," renowned for its trade operations, beautiful scenery, and welcoming atmosphere. Visitors are traditionally greeted with [[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/Jua La Va\|Jua La Va]]. [[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/Cusomi\|Cusomi]] is also where the first Ervenian laws were written, and it boasts the lowest crime rate in the kingdom.

- **Fiarma Zan:** Known as the "living city" due to its constant change and blend of living and dead nature. The city is famous for its Ervenian cuisine, particularly [[Amalon Wiki/Notable Locations/Jua La Va\|Jua La Va]] and roasted Rima, a green bird native to the region.

- **Dorohmer:** An ungoverned region known for its challenging environment and the presence of Yaebie trees. Those who venture into Dorohmer lose government protection and must be self-sufficient.

### Key Figures

- **[[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Pumer Pfy Joka\|Pumer Pfy Joka]]:** A skilled architect who contributed to the design of many notable buildings in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]], including the relics exhibit. He was tragically killed by an assassin.

- **[[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Zo Rei Wu\|Zo Rei Wu]]:** A mischievous and resourceful enchanter known for his insatiable thirst for knowledge and his fascination with pushing the boundaries of reality. He is an expert in Ervenian enchantments, particularly optitari and rynki, which differ significantly from [[Magic and Technology/Magic Systems/Astral Magic\|Astral Magic]]. [[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Zo Rei Wu\|Zo Rei Wu]] has a history of working with grotls, creatures from the realm of Vjani'thar, to assist him in his research and experiments. He once formed a pact with a [[Magic and Technology/Mythological Beings & Entities/La-Krosh\|La-Krosh]], a powerful entity, but the pact nearly resulted in mutual destruction due to his excessive use of its powers. This experience likely contributed to his cautious approach to realm traversal and his emphasis on understanding the potential consequences of his actions.
