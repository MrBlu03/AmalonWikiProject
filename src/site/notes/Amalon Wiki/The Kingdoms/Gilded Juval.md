## Overview

[[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] is a kingdom in Amalon characterised by its focus on wealth and material possessions. **The kingdom is starkly divided between the opulent rich and the impoverished poor**. Known for its skilled assassins and a culture that prioritises personal gain, [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] stands in contrast to the more nature-focused [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Ervenia\|Ervenia]] and the scholarly [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|High Valomor]].

### Culture

- **Materialism and Status:** The people of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] highly value wealth and social status. Those with riches enjoy a luxurious lifestyle, while the poor struggle to survive. This creates a society where advancement and recognition are often achieved through the accumulation of wealth, regardless of the means employed.
- **Pragmatism and Ruthlessness:** Juvali society is pragmatic and often ruthless in its pursuit of wealth and power. This is reflected in the kingdom's reputation for skilled assassins, who are highly sought after for their deadly expertise. The presence of [[Assassin's Guild\|Assassin's Guild]] suggests a culture that accepts and even encourages violence as a means to an end.
- **Entertainment and Celebration:** Despite its harsh realities, [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] has a vibrant culture of entertainment and celebration. **The popular card game [[Aintuli\|Aintuli]], named after a controversial historical figure, is widely enjoyed.** Celebrations often involve extravagant displays of wealth, such as fireworks and elaborate costumes. These festivities may serve as a distraction from the kingdom's social inequalities or as a way for the wealthy to flaunt their prosperity.

### Economy

- **Trade and Technology:** [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] has a thriving economy driven by trade and technological advancements. **[[Jua La Va\|Jua La Va]], the kingdom's main port city, is known for its rapidly developing technology in both economic and military sectors.** This suggests that Juval is a hub for innovation and industry within Amalon.
- **Gold and Currency:** As its name suggests, gold plays a central role in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's economy. The kingdom's currency is based on gold, and the precious metal is highly sought after. The abundance of gold in Juval may contribute to its economic power and influence within Amalon.
- **Corruption and Exploitation:** [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's economy is marred by corruption and the exploitation of the poor. Historical figures like [[Aintuli\|Aintuli]] are known for their schemes to siphon money from taxes paid by the lower classes. This suggests a system that favours the wealthy and perpetuates social inequality.

### Geography

- **Coastal Regions:** [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] possesses extensive coastlines with significant port cities like [[Jua La Va\|Jua La Va]], indicating a strong maritime presence and involvement in trade.

- **Urban Centres:** [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's cities are characterised by contrasts between opulent districts inhabited by the wealthy and impoverished areas where the poor reside. This urban divide is a visible representation of the kingdom's social inequalities.
- **Cemeteries and Graveyards:** **Jua Sai, a city built upon a former cemetery, is inhabited by descendants of gravediggers, suggesting a culture that is both pragmatic and perhaps desensitised to death.** This association with death may also reflect the kingdom's history of violence and conflict.

### History

- **Early History:** The sources provide limited details about the early history of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]]. However, it is known that the kingdom's focus on wealth and trade has been a defining characteristic for centuries. This suggests that Juval has long been a centre of commerce and a place where material possessions hold significant importance.
- **Rule of [[Aintuli\|Aintuli]]:** **[[Aintuli\|Aintuli]], a shrewd and ambitious figure, rose to prominence within [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]], implementing policies that increased the kingdom's wealth but also exacerbated social inequalities.** He established [[Jua La Va\|Jua La Va]] as a major trading hub and implemented strategies to increase the kingdom's economic dependence on itself. However, his reign was marked by corruption and self-serving schemes that ultimately led to his assassination.
- **Legacy of [[Aintuli\|Aintuli]]:** Despite his controversial legacy, [[Aintuli\|Aintuli]] remains a significant figure in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's history. The card game [[Aintuli\|Aintuli]], named in his honour (or perhaps mockery), suggests that his impact on the kingdom's culture continues to be felt. His assassination, which remains unsolved, serves as a reminder of the kingdom's volatile and often treacherous nature.

### Politics

- **Oligarchy and Corruption:** While the specific structure of [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's government is not explicitly described in the sources, it is implied that the kingdom is ruled by an oligarchy, with a small group of wealthy individuals holding significant power and influence. This system is likely prone to corruption, as evidenced by historical figures like [[Aintuli\|Aintuli]], who exploited their positions for personal gain.
- **Military Strength:** [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] possesses a powerful military force, the **Silver Knights**, who are renowned for their strength and effectiveness. The Silver Knights originated as guardsmen in the old capital, now known as the Unwelcomed City, and their role evolved into a formal military force as the kingdom's power and influence grew.

### Cities

- **[[Jua La Va\|Jua La Va]]:** A bustling port city known for its rapid technological advancements in both economic and military sectors. [[Jua La Va\|Jua La Va]] serves as [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's primary trading hub and is a major source of the kingdom's wealth. The city produces Rasha, a golden liquid used to coat objects, which is often misused for smuggling. This suggests that [[Jua La Va\|Jua La Va]] is a centre for both legitimate trade and illicit activities.
- **Golden Ramsen:** The second richest city in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]], known for its fast-paced trade and connections with [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|High Valomor]]. Golden Ramsen is also a centre for the production of skilled assassins, reinforcing [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's reputation for deadly expertise. The city's inhabitants celebrate their wealth with extravagant festivities, reflecting the kingdom's culture of materialism and ostentation.
- **Unwelcomed City (Ljunik'Ri):** A ruined and abandoned city that serves as a stark reminder of the kingdom's past and the consequences of its actions. [[Aintuli\|Aintuli]] erected a statue of himself in the city, highlighting his hubris and self-aggrandizement. The city's current state suggests that even [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] 's wealth and power are not immune to decline and decay.
- **Jua Sai:** A city built upon a former cemetery, inhabited by descendants of gravediggers. Jua Sai is responsible for tasks such as heavy lifting and corpse disposal, indicating a pragmatic approach to essential but often unpleasant duties. The city's connection to death may also reflect the kingdom's history of violence and a certain acceptance of mortality.

### Notable Locations

- **[[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Major Characters/Ryo Bin\|Ryo Bin]]:** The current leader of the [[Assassin's Guild\|Assassin's Guild]], based in [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]].

- **[[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Supporting Characters/Armid'Ro Podati\|Armid'Ro Podati]]:** A high-ranking Juvali official who orchestrates a plot to instigate a war between [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] and [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|High Valomor]] by framing [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'oth Vilgmeri]].

### Mythology and Folklore

### Relationships with Other Kingdoms

- **[[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'oth Vilgmeri]]:** [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/Gilded Juval\|Gilded Juval]] and R'Oth Vilgmeri have a history of conflict and mistrust.

[[Amalon Wiki/Characters/Supporting Characters/Armid'Ro Podati\|Armid'Ro Podati]] 's plot to frame [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/R'oth Vilgmeri\|R'oth Vilgmeri]] for the murder of a Valomorian scholar reveals a willingness to manipulate [[Amalon Wiki/The Kingdoms/High Valomor\|High Valomor]] for political gain.
